# Bulldozer_Prediction
Based on the Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers Competition, the goal is to predict the sale price of bulldozers sold at auctions.

In this notebook, we will go through an example machine learning project with the goal of predicting the sale price of bulldozers.

As the evaluation metric, this competition (2012) utilized root mean squared log error RMSLE between the actual price and the predicted auction prices.
